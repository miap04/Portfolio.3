We are implementing the game *Battleships* (source: [Battleship (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))). This project will involve enhancing the gameâ€™s user interface, with ANSI tools helping to create a more engaging experience.

**Core Requirements:**
Your work must build upon the code given. 
1. **Minimum Resolution Check:** Ensure that the game does not start if the current console window is below a set minimum resolution.
2. **Multilingual Support:** The game must support at least two languages, with players able to select their preferred language through a menu.
3. **Bug:** There is a bug in the mapLayoutScreen, fix it.  
4. **Full Game Playability:** Complete the "battleshipsScreen" to enable the player to experience a full game of Battleships, following the existing architecture.
5. **Refactor:** as allways clean and fix

All necessary techniques for completing this task have been demonstrated in class and are available in the current codebase. Best of luck!
